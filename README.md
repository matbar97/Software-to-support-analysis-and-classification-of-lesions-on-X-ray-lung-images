# Software-to-support-analysis-and-classification-of-lesions-on-X-ray-lung-images
This is the software to analyse and classify images of people lung X-rays to 5 different diseases categories. The pretrained MobileNetV2, VGG19, ResNet50 and SVM with fine-tuning were used for this task. The results are deeply compared and analysed using confusion matrices, ROC Curves, classification reports (accuracy, precision, recall, f - score).
